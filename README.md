# Math-Warrior
Java-based math game designed to help users retain mental math skills
Redesign so that each player object has a 2d array question bank inside of it
Randomly generate array indexes
When a question is asked, delete it from the 2d array
If randomly gen array indexes for a question that has already been asked, pick a new index value
